## Overview
### Description
An app that helps you manage your health by letting you see the results of your doctor visits (medications prescribed, lab results, physical results) 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Health
- **Mobile:** Can show you the location of your pharmacy pickup you sent it too and it also has a reminder feature that lets you know when your next appointment is
- **Story:** Make it easier for the user to keep track of their health and get their appointments/information all in one location
- **Market:** People who have to juggle around all of doctor appointments will probably need it on a more daily basis - currently, I plan on making it just for one individual but it would probably be useful to add a dependents feature for parents who have multiple kids and want to see that data as well
- **Habit:** Depending on their health, it could be weekly
- **Scope:** Figuring out how to get the location, work out the calendar/notifications for appointments
